        I’ve always been fascinated by making things. I learned how to blow glass when I was eleven, I started welding at thirteen.  When I was eighteen I wanted to be an artist.  I applied to art schools and left California to study at RISD.  There I majored in furniture design.  During this time I was exposed to CAD, which I took to instantly.  As I continued to explore the potentials of CAD and digital fabrication I came across grasshopper, a procedural modelling plug in for Rhino.  This was my first exposure to the basic concepts of programming and I loved it. After school I went to work at a design and mechanical engineering consultancy called Inch.  Inch held “work beautifully” as it’s motto. While there I learned to make products that worked beautifully, both as an experience and a mechanism.  Inch was a really small team, about five people, within my first few months I was leading projects and presenting to clients.  After working at Inch for a couple years it became clear to me that the really interesting features, the stuff I wanted to make, were on the software side.  I already knew that programming was something I enjoyed, but I needed to get better and fast.  I applied to a number of programming intensives, decided on Hack Reactor. I've been working as software developer since completing the program in 2013.</span>
